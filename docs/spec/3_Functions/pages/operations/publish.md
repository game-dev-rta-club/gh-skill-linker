# Publish

Add an unmanaged local skill to an existing repository, then record the
synchronization point in the manifest after remote success.

## PUB-001 Local preflight

`OWNER/REPO`, a local selector, and a branch are required. The selector is a
name or `.agents/skills/<name>`.

Reject:

- a skill already registered in the manifest
- a path outside the project, symlink, or non-regular file
- a name/directory mismatch, invalid `SKILL.md`, marker, or LFS pointer
- an ignored local file
- a read-only repository

The remote path is `skills/<name>`. Repository creation, arbitrary path
selection, tags, relinking, migration, and copying are not supported.

## PUB-002 Remote mutation

- branch exists, path absent: add the subtree through a normal push
- branch exists, tree SHA matches: adopt the existing subtree without a commit
- branch exists, path differs: reject
- repository has no refs: create the requested branch through the first normal
  push
- repository has refs, branch absent: reject

Compare bytes, relative paths, and executable bits as a Git tree. An ancestor
that is a file or symlink is also a mismatch.

If the normal push after cloning is non-fast-forward, reject it as remote
changed. Do not modify unrelated content.

## PUB-003 Manifest registration

After remote success, add the entry only when the manifest still matches the
version read at the start. Record repository, source path/ref, commit/tree SHA,
and destination in one write. There is no process lock.

Do not roll back the remote after a manifest failure. A rerun can adopt the
identical remote subtree and retry only manifest registration.
