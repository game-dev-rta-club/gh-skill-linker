# Push

Reject a tag source with `source_ref_read_only` before local validation,
permission checks, or remote operations.

Return the local snapshot to the same source branch as a normal commit.

## PUSH-001 Eligibility enforcement

Recheck:

- selector is unique
- path is inside the project and contains no symlink
- local files are regular files
- no conflict markers remain
- `SKILL.md` is valid and its name matches the managed name
- files are tracked or untracked but not ignored
- repository push permission exists
- current source skill tree equals the baseline

Tracked and untracked non-ignored files can be pushed. A tracked file remains
eligible even when it matches an ignore rule. A new file does not need to be
added to the Git index first.

The permission check is a repository-level preflight. A branch-protection or
ruleset rejection appears as a PUSH-003 error from the actual push.

## PUSH-002 No-op

When local equals current, do not commit. When the tree is identical but only
the commit SHA advanced, update the manifest.

## PUSH-003 Remote mutation

Clone with `--branch --single-branch --no-tags --depth 1`. Recheck that
`HEAD:<sourcePath>` equals the expected tree SHA, then replace only the selected
subtree.

Write files with `0644/0755` and run `git add -A -- <sourcePath>`. Do not commit
when there is no difference.

- author: `gh-linked-skills <gh-linked-skills@users.noreply.github.com>`
- message: `chore(skill): sync <skill-name>`
- refspec: `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>`

Never force. Non-fast-forward means `remote changed`. If the manifest fails
after a push, do not roll back the remote; require a pull to reconcile.
