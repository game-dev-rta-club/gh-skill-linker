# User guide

`gh-skill-linker` installs Agent Skills from GitHub into `.agents/skills/` and
records their source in `.gh-skill-linker.json`. Run it from the Git project
that should use the skills.

## 1. Install the extension

Requirements:

- macOS or Linux
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and system Git
- GitHub authentication from `gh auth login` or a supported token environment
  variable

```sh
gh extension install game-dev-rta-club/gh-skill-linker
gh skill-linker --help
```

Upgrade later with:

```sh
gh extension upgrade skill-linker
```

Users of the extension under its former name must follow the
[rename migration guide](migration-to-skill-linker.md) instead.

## 2. Choose a source

Every install requires a GitHub repository and either a tag or a branch.

| Source | Choose it when | Available synchronization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tag | You consume a reviewed release | `status`; no `pull` or `push` |
| Branch | You author or collaborate on the source | `status`, `pull`, and `push` |

There is no implicit default branch, local-directory source, or floating
version range. The source is always explicit.

### Install from a tag

List the skills available at a release:

```sh
gh skill-linker install OWNER/REPO --tag TAG
```

Install one skill by the displayed name or path, or install all discovered
skills:

```sh
gh skill-linker install OWNER/REPO SKILL --tag TAG
gh skill-linker install OWNER/REPO --all --tag TAG
```

To move an existing tag-backed skill to a new tag, name that skill or its exact
source path. The command stops if local changes would be overwritten.

```sh
gh skill-linker install OWNER/REPO SKILL --tag NEW_TAG
```

Tag upgrades are intentionally one skill at a time; `--all` does not re-pin
already installed skills.

### Install from a branch

List the available skills, then install one:

```sh
gh skill-linker install OWNER/REPO --branch BRANCH
gh skill-linker install OWNER/REPO SKILL --branch BRANCH
```

Use `--all` to install every discovered skill from the same branch revision:

```sh
gh skill-linker install OWNER/REPO --all --branch BRANCH
```

## 3. Review and commit the result

An install creates or updates:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill>/...
.gh-skill-linker.json
```

Review both, then commit them to the parent project so collaborators receive
the skill content and its source record together.

```sh
git diff -- .agents/skills .gh-skill-linker.json
git add .agents/skills .gh-skill-linker.json
git commit -m "chore: install agent skills"
gh skill-linker status
```

`STATE` describes the direction of the difference:

| State | Meaning | Typical next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clean` | Local and source content match | None |
| `pull` | The source changed | `pull` |
| `push` | The local skill changed | Review, then `push` |
| `conflict` | Both sides changed or markers remain | Resolve the conflict |

The `PULL` and `PUSH` columns separately show whether each operation is
eligible and, when it is not, the reason.

## Collaborate on a branch

Bring source changes into a managed skill:

```sh
gh skill-linker pull SKILL
```

If both sides changed, the command performs a three-way merge. Text conflicts
are written as Git-style markers for you to resolve; binary or structural
conflicts stop without changing the affected file.

After editing and reviewing a branch-backed skill, send it to the source:

```sh
gh skill-linker status
gh skill-linker push SKILL
```

Push uses a normal Git commit, never a force push. It stops if the remote skill
changed since the last synchronization, so you can pull and review first. The
extension does not commit or push the parent project.

## Publish a new local skill

Create `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, then publish it to an existing GitHub
repository where you have push access:

```sh
gh skill-linker publish OWNER/REPO SKILL --branch BRANCH
git add .gh-skill-linker.json
git commit -m "chore: track published skill"
```

The remote path is `skills/<name>`. Existing different content is not
overwritten, and the extension does not create the repository for you.

## Uninstall a skill

```sh
gh skill-linker uninstall SKILL
```

Uninstall removes the local skill and its manifest entry without changing the
source repository. It refuses to delete local changes. Use `--force` only after
you have reviewed and intentionally decided to discard those changes.
